### 1. First you need to clone this repository to your local maching with the command:
> git clone https://github.com/BasharBetta7/python_programming_task_11.git
### 2. Go to your specified path inside your local machine and make sure you are inside the directory "tasks":
> cd ./tasks
### 3. Create a virtual environment with: 
> python -m venv venv
### 4. Activate the created environment:
> source venv/bin/activate
### 5. Install dependencies:
> pip install -r requirements.txt

if you faced any errors while executing the previous command, you can manually install `pytest` by running:
 > pip install pytest


Now you can start solving the tasks one by one. When running your scripts, make sure you are inside the directory "./tasks", otherwise, you may face problems with module imports.

After solving each task according to the description provided in the LMS, you must run the checker script (information are provided in LMS homework).
